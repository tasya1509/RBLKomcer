# Parking Car Detection System
This project is a Parking Car Detection System that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect cars in a parking lot image. It is designed to be deployed for monitoring the number of cars parked at the ITERA campus parking area. The system runs on Python and utilizes the YOLOv8 model for object detection.

# How it works
1. Image Input: The system accepts an image input (static image or live feed) that captures the parking area.
2. Object Detection: YOLOv8 model is used to detect cars in the image.
3. Bounding Box Visualization: Detected cars are highlighted with bounding boxes drawn on the image.
4. Car Count: The system returns the total number of cars detected.

# Features
- Real-time object detection with YOLOv8.
- Easy-to-use interface for uploading images.
- Visualization of detected cars with bounding boxes.
- Counts the total number of cars in the parking lot.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the script
